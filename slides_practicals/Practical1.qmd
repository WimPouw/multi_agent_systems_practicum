## Practicum 1: Objectives

* **Overview:** Introduction to the practicum.
* **Setup:** NetLogo and Python Mesa environment setup.
* **Coding Style:** Study coding style differences in NetLogo and Python, focusing on the flocking and fire models.
* **Basics:** Initialize basic setups.

# Overview of the practicum
- We have one landing page: [Practicum Landing Page](https://example.com)
- Models, slides, and literature.

# Getting set up with Netlogo
- getting started with Netlogo
- Download and install: [Netlogo Download](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).

## Installing Mesa
```bash
conda create -n mesa-env python=3.11
conda activate mesa-env
pip install mesa[all]==3.2.0
pip install jupyter notebook seaborn pandas numpy matplotlib
python -c "import mesa; print(f'Mesa version: {mesa.__version__}')"
```

## Installing Mesa
- Of course feel free to use your own Python environment, but we will use a conda environment for the practicum as the recommended procedure. 

# Downloading models
- Lets download models from our practicum landing page
- Lets download the basic Netlogo models
- Lets download the basic Mesa models

# Start to take notes!
- Start to build your own notes
- How do you set up a group of agents on a grid in NetLogo and Mesa?
- How do you set up a group of agents on a continuous space in NetLogo and Mesa?
