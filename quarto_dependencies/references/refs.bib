  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a powerful simulation modeling technique that has seen a number of applications in the last few years, including applications to real-world business problems. After the basic principles of agent-based simulation are briefly introduced, its four areas of application are discussed by using real-world applications: flow simulation, organizational simulation, market simulation, and diffusion simulation. For each category, one or several business applications are described and analyzed.}

However, citations are widely used to estimate the productivity of researchers and institutions, effectively creating a 'grubby' motivation to be well-cited. We model citation growth, and this grubby interest using an agent-based model (ABM) of network growth. In this model, each new node (article) in a citation network is an autonomous agent that cites other nodes based on a 'citation personality' consisting of a composite bias for locality, preferential attachment, recency, and fitness. We ask whether strategic citation behavior (reference selection) by the author of a scientific article can boost subsequent citations to it. Our study suggests that fitness and, to a lesser extent, out\_degree and locality effects are influential in capturing citations, which raises questions about similar effects in the real world.},

  abstract = {When a population exhibits collective cognitive alignment, such that group members tend to perceive, remember, and reproduce information in similar ways, the features of socially transmitted variants (i.e., artifacts, behaviors) may converge over time towards culture-specific equilibria points, often called cultural attractors. Because cognition may be plastic, shaped through experience with the cultural products of others, collective cognitive alignment and stable cultural attractors cannot always be taken for granted, but little is known about how these patterns first emerge and stabilize in initially uncoordinated populations. We propose that stable cultural attractors can emerge from general principles of human categorization and communication. We present a model of cultural attractor dynamics, which extends a model of unsupervised category learning in individuals to a multiagent setting wherein learners provide the training input to each other. Agents in our populations spontaneously align their cognitive category structures, producing emergent cultural attractor points. We highlight three interesting behaviors exhibited by our model: (1) noise enhances the stability of cultural category structures; (2) short `critical' periods of learning early in life enhance stability; and (3) larger populations produce more stable but less complex attractor landscapes, and cliquish network structure can mitigate the latter effect. These results may shed light on how collective cognitive alignment is achieved in the absence of shared, innate cognitive attractors, which we suggest is important to the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {Social media networks have drastically changed how people communicate and seek information. Due to the scale of information on these platforms, newsfeed curation algorithms have been developed to sort through this information and curate what users see. However, these algorithms are opaque and it is difficult to understand their impact on human communication flows. Some papers have criticised newsfeed curation algorithms that, while promoting user engagement, heighten online polarisation, misinformation, and the formation of echo chambers. Agent-based modelling offers the opportunity to simulate the complex interactions between these algorithms, what users see, and the propagation of information on social media. This article uses agent-based modelling to compare the impact of four different newsfeed curation algorithms on the spread of misinformation and polarisation. This research has the following contributions: (1) implementing newsfeed curation algorithm logic on an agent-based model; (2) comparing the impact of different curation algorithm objectives on misinformation and polarisation; and (3) calibration and empirical validation using real Twitter data. This research provides useful insights into the impact of curation algorithms on how information propagates and on content diversity on social media. Moreover, we show how agent-based modelling can reveal specific properties of curation algorithms, which can be used in improving such algorithms.}

This includes its core components: 1) the model (Model, Agent, Schedule, and Space), 2) analysis (Data Collector and Batch Runner) and the visualization (Visualization Server and Visualization Browser Page). We then discuss how agent-based models can be created in Mesa. This is followed by a discussion of applications and extensions by other researchers to demonstrate how Mesa design is decoupled and extensible and thus creating the opportunity for a larger decentralized ecosystem of packages that people can share and reuse for their own needs. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and discussion of future development areas for Mesa.},

  abstract = {Theories of the evolution of cooperation through reciprocity explain how unrelated self-interested individuals can accomplish more together than they can on their own. The most prominent theories of reciprocity, such as tit-for-tat or win-stay-lose-shift, are inflexible automata that lack a theory of mind---the human ability to infer the hidden mental states in others' minds. Here, we develop a model of reciprocity with a theory of mind, the Bayesian Reciprocator. When making decisions, this model does not simply seek to maximize its own payoff. Instead, it also values the payoffs of others---but only to the extent it believes that those others are also cooperating in the same way. To compute its beliefs about others, the Bayesian Reciprocator uses a probabilistic and generative approach to infer the latent preferences, beliefs, and strategies of others through interaction and observation. We evaluate the Bayesian Reciprocator using a generator over games where every interaction is unique, as well as in classic environments such as the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The Bayesian Reciprocator enables the emergence of both direct-reciprocity when games are repeated and indirect-reciprocity when interactions are one-shot but observable to others. In an evolutionary competition, the Bayesian Reciprocator outcompetes existing automata strategies and sustains cooperation across a larger range of environments and noise settings than prior approaches. This work quantifies the advantage of a theory of mind for cooperation in an evolutionary game theoretic framework and suggests avenues for building artificially intelligent agents with more human-like learning mechanisms that can cooperate across many environments.}

  abstract = {Computational cognitive models typically focus on individual behavior in isolation. Models frequently employ closed-form solutions in which a state of the system can be computed if all parameters and functions are known. However, closed-form models are challenged when used to predict behaviors for dynamic, adaptive, and heterogeneous agents. Such systems are complex and typically cannot be predicted or explained by analytical solutions without application of significant simplifications. In addressing this problem, cognitive and social psychological sciences may profitably use agent-based models, which are widely employed to simulate complex systems. We show that these models can be used to explore how cognitive models scale in social networks to calibrate model parameters, to validate model predictions, and to engender model development. Agent-based models allow for controlled experiments of complex systems and can explore how changes in low-level parameters impact the behavior at a whole-system level. They can test predictions of cognitive models and may function as a bridge between individually and socially oriented models. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

We show that these cycles of word usage organize into semantically coherent clusters that track, interact with, or precede macroeconomic rhythms. To explore the nature of this interaction, we build on a minimal mathematical model that captures usage dynamics through parameters linked to real world processes. Parameter fitting reveals that word usage operates near a Hopf bifurcation, a critical regime associated with heightened sensitivity, uncovering a robust and specific coupling between language usage and economic activity. In linguistic datasets that allow long term quantitative analysis, rooted in capitalist contexts, this coupling appears as an oscillatory dynamic, reflecting a feedback process in which language both shapes material reality and manages the changes it produces.},

  abstract = {Tracking what others did and matching other's expected actions is seen across a range of biological systems. As reciprocal matching rewards and reinforces cooperators and punishes and discourages non-cooperators, reciprocal matching can help communal living. The strength of reciprocity as a social strategy also comes from its success in protecting the individual against the risk of exploitation by punishing defectors. Although often overlooked, this feature carries a strong weight when exploitation risk is high. Here, we use evolutionary agent-based simulations to examine how reciprocal matching evolves across competitive socio-ecologies with a high risk of exploitation and cooperative socio-ecologies with a lower risk of exploitation. Results show that reciprocal matching as a social strategy for communal living evolves more readily in more competitive socio-ecologies where the risk of exploitation is high. Results also hold in standard Prisoner's Dilemmas with its equilibrium in single strategies (i.e. unconditional non-cooperation), for specific forms of reciprocity (i.e. tit-for-tat) and the likelihood of repeated interactions. Because reciprocal matching requires some capacity for social perception and memory, these findings suggest that such capacities for social cognition likewise serve to protect against exploitation and evolved in more competitive socio-ecologies as well.},

They can switch between independent and collective modes of behavior, and flexible switching can be advantageous for adapting to ongoing changes in conditions. In the present study, we investigated the flexibility between independent and collective modes of behavior in a simulated social foraging task designed to benefit from both modes: distancing among ten foraging agents promoted faster detection of resources, whereas flocking promoted faster consumption. There was a tradeoff between faster detection versus faster consumption, but both factors contributed to foraging success. Results showed that group foraging performance among simulated agents was enhanced by~loose coupling~that balanced distancing and flocking among agents and enabled them to fluidly switch among a variety of groupings. We also examined the effects of more sophisticated cognitive capacities by studying how human players improve performance when they control one of the search agents. Results showed that human intervention further enhanced group performance with loosely coupled agents, and human foragers performed better when coordinating with loosely coupled agents. Humans players adapted their balance of independent versus collective search modes in response to the dynamics of simulated agents, thereby demonstrating the importance of adaptive flexibility in social foraging.},

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more---both farther and faster---on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5\% margin in only 22\% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental trade-off: Random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement.}

  abstract = {Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.},
